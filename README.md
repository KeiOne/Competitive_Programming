Algorithms and data structures used in competitive programming

Here's algorithms used for problem solving and used in programming contests such as
ACM ICPC or other programming contests.

Note that the algorithms that are implemented here are designed to be "well coded" and as clear as possible, so they might not be the best minimal code to be implemented in a real life contest(specially an "on site" contest) since it takes time to implement and code these algorithms.

The main goal here is to represent a good reference for some of the famous algorithms and data structures used in competitive programming. and I try to present a readible code for the educational purposes. //
